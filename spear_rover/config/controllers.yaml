    # DiffDriveController isn't really meant for skid-steering, so it doesn't
    # understand that the robot is actually turning much slower than it is asked
    # to (DiffDriveController is using open loop control). To compensate for this,
    # use a model with a much larger wheel separation distance, which will move
    # the wheels faster during turns.
    # This works in simulation. Not sure if this value is still appropriate for the
    # real robot, but we can worry about that when we start using
    # DiffDriveController for the real robot.
