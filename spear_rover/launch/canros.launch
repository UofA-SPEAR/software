	This launch file will, by default, launch the canros server such that
	it listens to the "can0" device. You can change it by passing in an
	"interface" argument, e.g:

		$ roslaunch spear_rover rover2_can.launch interface:=vcan0

	...will make the canros server listen to the "vcan0" device. This is
		good for local testing.

  <!--
	canros's server uses a launch file to run, so instead of using the
	<node> tag like we do everywhere else we have to use the <include>
  	tag and pass in arguments.
