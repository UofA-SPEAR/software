# DiffDriveController isn't really meant for skid-steering, so it doesn't
# understand that the robot is actually turning much slower than it is asked
# to (DiffDriveController is using open loop control). To compensate for this,
# use a model with a much larger wheel separation distance, which will move
# the wheels faster during turns.
# This works in simulation. Not sure if this value is still appropriate for the
# real robot, but we can worry about that when we start using
# DiffDriveController for the real robot.
