# armik #

This is the package generated by MoveIt's Setup Assistant. The source URDF along with the meshes can be found in the spear_rover package in the src subfolder.

See below for short descriptions of some of the available launch files. Many more are located in the package, but these are the most important when setting up, I believe.

## Launch Files ##

### setup_assistant

Opens the MoveIt Setup Assistant to edit this package.

### moveit_rviz

Seems only to open RViz with the default configuration. Probably more useful once we create a node to interface with MoveIt's API and control the arm from there.

### demo

Launches RViz with the model and IK panels set up. Currently, IK doesn't work so some configurations will need to be tweaked.

### demo_gazebo

Same as above, but also launches Gazebo for simulations.
