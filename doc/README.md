# Documentation

This directory contains higher level documentation related to the codebase.
Lower level code documentation (such as documenting the parameters of a function) should go directly in the code as docstrings, doxygen comments, etc.

## Directory Structure

- `code-overview`: High-level documentation of the code.

- `install`: Additional documentation for installing the necessary tools to develop ROS code. 
  Note: most of the documentation for this is in the README at the top level of this repo.

- `onboarding`: Resources for new members. Includes the new member activity.
